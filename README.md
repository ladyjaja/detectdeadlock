# Detect Deadlock
Simulating CMH for And Model Deadlock Detection Algorithm in Modified Dining Philosophers Problem


This is a simulation of deadlock detection in Distributed System.  The Dining Philosophers problem was modified to provide more deadlock situations.  Aside from the 5 forks, bread and soup were added to the mix.  Giving credit to where credit is due, I just modified the codes from  https://github.com/KLdivergence/-dining-philosophers-problem


For deadlock detection, Chandy-Misra-Haas for And Model Algorithm was used.

Run:

- ModifiedDiningPhilosophers.py to check the dynamics of the Dining Philosophers
- Test.py to check DetectDeadlock.py.  You may change the contents or inventory to test Detecting Deadlock
- DiningPhilosophers.py to simulate the CMH for And Model deadlock detection algorithm in Modified Dining Philosophers Problem
